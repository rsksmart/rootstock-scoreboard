# Governance Voting Dashboard

This project is a voting dashboard built using Next.js and integrated with Rootstock Network (EVM compatible smart contracts). It allows users to create teams and vote using governance tokens (ERC20). The voting process is controlled by the `TeamsManager` smart contract, which manages the creation of teams and tracks the votes.

## Features

- **Create Teams**: Users can create new teams by providing a team name, a meme token address, and a team leader address.
- **Vote for Teams**: Users can vote for their preferred team using governance tokens.
- **Token Balance**: The system tracks the voting token balance of the team leaders.
- **Smart Contracts Integration**: The project uses smart contracts for handling votes, team management, and governance token transactions.
- **ERC20 Support**: The voting process is based on ERC20 tokens, ensuring decentralized governance.

## Smart Contract: TeamsManager

The core of the project revolves around the `TeamsManager` smart contract (found in Contracts folder), written in Solidity. This contract manages team creation, voting, and tracking the votes. Below is a high-level description of the contract:

### Functions

- **vote(teamName, transferAmount)**: Allows users to vote for a team by transferring governance tokens.
- **getTeamNames()**: Returns a list of all registered teams.
- **getTeamInfo(teamName)**: Provides detailed information about a team.
- **getScore(teamName)**: Retrieves the current vote score of a team.
- **addTeam(teamName, memeTokenAddress, teamLeaderAddress)**: Allows administrators to add a new team.
- **setReadyToVote()**: Marks the contract as ready for voting (only callable by admins).
- **reset()**: Resets the voting state and team information (only callable by admins).

## Environment Variables

The project requires the following environment variables to function correctly. These should be set in your `.env` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_MANAGER_ADDRESS=<Smart contract address for the TeamsManager>
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=<Ethereum network RPC URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER=<Blockchain explorer URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_URL=<Pinata URL for IPFS data>
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOVERNANCE_TOKEN=<Governance token contract address>
```


## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed.
- **Metamask or Web3 Wallet**: A Web3 wallet is required for signing transactions and interacting with the blockchain.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file and populate it with the environment variables listed above.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard.

## Smart Contract Deployment

The `TeamsManager` contract should be deployed to the Rootstock testnet network, and its address should be provided in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_MANAGER_ADDRESS` environment variable. The contract source code can be found in the `contracts` directory.

The variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOVERNANCE_TOKEN` should contain the address of the ERC20 token used for voting.





# Frontend Updates

## Overview
This update enhances the frontend by integrating smart contract events and improving user feedback for key actions like adding teams and voting.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Event Handling for Smart Contract Transactions
- **Added event listeners** to capture and display real-time updates when teams are added, votes are cast, or teams are reset.
- Integrated `ethers.js` to listen for the following contract events:
  - `TeamAddedSuccessfully`
  - `TeamResetSuccessfully`
  - `TeamVotedSuccessfully`
- Notifications are displayed using `react-toastify` when an event is emitted.

### 2. UI Enhancements
- **Improved feedback for users** by showing success messages when:
  - A team is added successfully.
  - A vote is cast successfully.
  - Teams are reset.
- Users are now informed in real time about their interactions with the smart contract.

### 3. Contract Interaction
- **Refactored contract interaction logic** for better structure and maintainability.
- Introduced `useEffect` hooks to set up and clean up event listeners dynamically when the component mounts or unmounts.

## Setup Instructions
To use the updated frontend:
1. Ensure that your wallet is connected to the appropriate network.
2. Deploy the updated smart contract if not already deployed.
3. Run the frontend project:
   ```sh
   yarn install  # Install dependencies
   yarn run dev  # Start the development server
   ```

## Next Steps
- Further optimize state management by integrating event-driven UI updates.
- Improve error handling for contract interactions.
- Extend event tracking for additional smart contract actions.
